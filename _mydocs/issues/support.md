OKVIZ offers direct support to users who have problems with premium visuals and provides a dedicated forum for assistance with free visuals.

## Technical Issues

To report a bug with OKVIZ visuals, please follow the directions below:

1. Check if your problem already exists in the dedicated [Issues page](#issues-pages).

2. If you don't find anything relevant, insert a new issue including as much details as possible.

3. Include a sample report file that reproduces the issue. If your report contains private data or you cannot share it publicly for any reason, please **recreate it with dummy data**.

>> **IMPORTANT**: We cannot guarantee bug fixes without a sample file!

### Issues Pages

### Diagnostic Data

In some cases, when, for example, you cannot share reports with us and cannot reproduce the problem locally with dummy data, we may ask you to send us visual diagnostic data. To do so:

1. Open your report with [Power BI service](https://app.powerbi.com)

2. Click the ***About*** settings section of the visual and activate the ***Diagnostics*** toggle.

3. Open the browser console panel - With Chrome you can just press Ctrl + Shift + J (Cmd + Option + J on Mac);  alternatively, you can use the top right menu in the browser window, select the option ***More Tools***, then ***Developer Tools*** and click the ***Console*** tab.

4. Be sure to clear all filters from the console by clicking the drop-down menu next to the filter input box.

5. Right-click on the empty space of the console panel and choose **Save as...**

6. Take a screenshot of the console and [send it us](mailto:support@okviz.com) along with the file you just saved on your system.


### Microsoft Support

Sometimes the issue you want to report is not related to our code or affects custom visuals from other vendors too.  
In such cases, it is best to open a support ticket with Microsoft:

- If you are a tenant administrator, you can use the following link:  
    [https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/newsupportticket/powerbipro](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/newsupportticket/powerbipro)
