**Synoptic Panel** is a custom visual for Power BI that allows users to display data dynamically across custom images or maps, which are not restricted to geographic representations. These images, [referred to as maps](./concepts/maps/index), consist of defined areas that can be dynamically highlighted or colored based on the underlying data, providing a visually engaging way to present spatial or structured data directly within Power BI reports.

Synoptic Panel is available in three different versions:

- **Synoptic Panel v1**: The original version of the visual which is now deprecated.

- **Synoptic Panel v2**: The latest and most advanced version of the visual.

- **Synoptic Panel Lite**: A simplified, limited version of the v2 which is certified by Microsoft.

For more information about the different versions, see the [Versions page](versions/index.md).

>> **IMPORTANT**: The documentation on this site refers to the latest version of Synoptic Panel (v2) unless otherwise specified. If you are still using the original version (v1), we recommend upgrading to the latest version to take advantage of the new features and improvements.
