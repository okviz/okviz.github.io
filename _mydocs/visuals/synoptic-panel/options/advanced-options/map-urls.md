These options control the behavior of the ***Map URLs*** field. 

This feature allows remote maps to be loaded from a column or measure and controlled through an external filter. See [Map URLs](../../features/filtering-maps.md#map-urls) for more information.

## Show Full URLs

**Default value:** Off

If enabled, the full map URL is used as map title, otherwise only the last part of the path is shown.
