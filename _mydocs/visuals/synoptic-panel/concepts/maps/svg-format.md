The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format is a widely used format for vector graphics. It is a text-based format that describes the paths of the shapes in the image. The SVG format is supported by all modern browsers and is the format used by Synoptic Panel to render the maps, with the guarantee of **no loss of quality at any resolution or zoom level**. 

```svg
<!-- A sample SVG -->
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 175 175">
    <path id="layer1" d="M14.62,..." style="fill:#797774" />
    <path id="layer2" d="M158.99,..." style="fill:#444" />
    <path id="layer3" d="M14.62,..." style="fill:#c8c6c4" />
</svg>
```

If you are new to SVG, here are some useful resources:
- [How to create, edit and export SVG files](creating-svg.md)
- [SVG tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial) on MDN Web Docs

Below is a reference guide to the SVG format and the custom attributes supported by Synoptic Panel.

## Shapes
Shapes are the basic elements of an SVG file. They can be used to define **areas** in the map. These elements are defined with tags `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, `<line>`, `<path>`, `<polygon>`, `<polyline>`, or `<rect>`.

## Groups
Groups are used to group multiple shapes together. They can be used to define **areas** in the map. The `<g>` tag is used to defines groups and it encloses shapes or other groups.


## Areas

In Synoptic Panel, **an area is a shape or group of shapes that has been linked to a specific data point**. 

You can "transform" an SVG element into an area by setting the element `id`, set the `data-okviz-strong` attribute (see below), or assign the element to a data point through the [Map Editor](../../features/map-editor/index.md). Areas can be highlighted, colored, or labeled based on the underlying data, allowing interactivity and drill-down capabilities.

## Id Attribute

The `id` attribute is used to uniquely identify an element in the SVG file. This attribute can be used to [automatically bind the element to a data point](../data-binding.md).

Note that:
  - The `id` must be a valid XML ID, which means it must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, colons, and periods. Spaces are also allowed, but not recommended. If the id starts with a digit, it should be escaped with an underscore (`1` should become `_1`).
  - The value of each `id` must be unique within the map, as defined by the SVG specification. If you have multiple elements with the same identifier, all of these elements will be linked to the same data point (in the case of successfully automatic binding). If this is the desired behavior, it is generally recommended to use unique `id` values for each element and to use the `data-okviz-strong` attribute (see below) or the [Map Editor](../../features/map-editor/index.md) to bind multiple areas to the same data point.

## Custom Attributes

Here is a list of custom SVG attributes supported by Synoptic Panel. 

Note that most of these attributes have an equivalent setting in the visual interface, but using the custom attribute can save time and avoid errors, especially when using remote maps or generating maps programmatically. Also, **custom attributes have precedence over the visual settings**.

<style>
table td:first-of-type code { /* Attribute */
    white-space: nowrap;
}
table th:nth-of-type(2) { /* Target */
    width: 110px
}
</style>
|Attribute                  |Target                 |Description|
|---                        |---                    |---|
|`data-okviz-unbound`       |Any shape or group     |*(Boolean)* Excludes the element from the [Data Binding](../data-binding.md).|
|`data-okviz-strong`        |Any shape or group     |*(String)* Forces the element to bind to a specific data point, regardless of its id. See [Data Binding](../data-binding.md).|
|`data-okviz-drill-url`     |Any area               |*(String)* It must contain the URL of a remote SVG map. With this attribute you can automatically load a different remote map when drilling down on the area. More on the [Drill Mode](../../features/drill-mode.md) section.|
|`data-okviz-link-url`      |Any shape              |*(String)* It must contain a remote URL. By clicking a shape with this attribute, you navigate to the URL defined there. |
|`data-okviz-svg-author`    |`<svg>`                |*(String)* It is used to show the map author name in the visual.|
|`data-okviz-svg-attribution`|`<svg>`               |*(String)* It is used to show the map attribution in the visual.|
|`data-okviz-autofetch`     |`<svg>`                |*(String or Boolean)* Enables the [Auto-Fetch mode](../../features/drill-mode.md#auto-fetch-mode) on the specified attribute. When it is `true`, it means that the `id` will be used.|
|`data-okviz-no-labels`     |`<svg>` or any area    |*(Boolean)* Turn off all map labels or the labels on the target area.|   

Example:

```svg
<!-- A sample SVG with a custom attribute -->
<svg data-okviz-svg-attribution="Copyright OKVIZ">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
</svg>
```

## Unsupported Elements and Attributes
SVG format supports a wide range of elements and attributes, but not all of them are supported by Synoptic Panel, due to security and performance reasons. These are not supported:

- Event handler attributes like `onclick`, `onload`, `onerror`, etc.
- JavaScript-enabled attributes like `href` with JavaScript protocol (`javascript:`)
- Scripts (`<script>`)
- Foreign objects (`<foreignObject>`)
