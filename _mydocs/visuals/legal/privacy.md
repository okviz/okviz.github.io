Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to our Custom Visuals. Our website and other online services may be subject to a separate privacy policy.

## Usage of Your Data by Company

You may provide us with data directly or via an external website or authentication agency, which may include your name, email address, password, entities or companies you are associated with, and any other relevant data. We retain, process, and use this data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and may access your data for the following reasons:

- To provide you with information about our services and other items that may be of interest, consistent with this Privacy Policy;
- To notify you of changes in the services we provide;
- To administer your account to allow you to use the Custom Visual;
- To manage the licensing associated with your account for the Custom Visual;
- To provide you with promotional material, in accordance with applicable terms and law;
- To customize the services we provide to you;
- To enable us to provide advertisements regarding our products, services, and offerings;
- To conduct questionnaires and surveys to improve our products and services. Participation is voluntary;
- To meet contractual obligations; and
- To comply with applicable regulatory requirements and export laws.  
  
Company and its products, technologies, and services are subject to export laws of various countries, including those of the European Union and the United States. You acknowledge that, pursuant to these laws, Company may be required to take measures to prevent entities or parties listed on sanctioned party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and services. 

In such cases, Company may:
  1. Automatically check user registration data and other information you provide against sanctioned party lists.
  2. Repeat such checks when sanctioned party lists are updated or your information changes.
  3. Block your access to Company’s services and systems in case of a potential match.
  4. Contact you to confirm your identity if a potential match is found.

## Sharing Your Data

Data collected on or through the Custom Visual may be transferred between countries and processed globally. Servers or processing facilities used by Company may be located within or outside the European Economic Area (EEA). In all cases, we safeguard your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection principles.

All Company affiliates may use this information internationally to process inquiries and orders, provide services to you, and help improve our products and services, as well as to keep you informed of product updates, offers, and other related information. Where legally required, we may provide you with marketing materials only if you have given prior consent or have not opted out.

We may also share information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents, or contractors to provide requested services or transactions—such as processing orders, credit card transactions, hosting websites, events, or registrations, providing customer support, or analyzing user behavior. We only share the minimum data necessary for these services and, where legally required, we ensure that third parties are bound by appropriate data processing agreements and confidentiality obligations.

We do not sell or rent your data to third parties for marketing purposes.

We may disclose your data as required by law, such as responding to subpoenas or legal processes, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

If Company decides to sell, buy, merge, or reorganize its businesses, such transactions may involve the disclosure of data to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of data from sellers, in accordance with applicable law. It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these transactions.

We may collect and share data to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to physical safety, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

This Privacy Policy applies each time you submit data through the Custom Visual. Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and the most up-to-date version will always be available with the Custom Visual documentation.

## Information We Collect When You Use The Custom Visual

Apart from the data you voluntarily provide when signing up or authenticating via a third-party authentication provider, we do not involuntarily log or transmit any actions, events, or data managed or visualized within the Custom Visual to our servers.

## Security of Your Data

We are committed to protecting your data. Company uses a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We bind our employees and data processors to respect your privacy and maintain confidentiality.

## Links to External Sites

The Custom Visual or related documentation may contain links to external sites. Company and its affiliates are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these external websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any external site you visit.

## Data Retention

We will not retain your data longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws. If no statutory obligation exists, we will delete your data if you request us to do so. In such cases, certain services or functionalities may become limited or unavailable.

If you have questions about data retention or wish to have your data deleted, please contact us at [support@okviz.com](mailto:support@okviz.com]).

## Contacting You

We may contact you by email, SMS, phone, or other methods if you provide the necessary contact details and do not opt out of such communications. If you choose to give us your email address, we will communicate with you via email but will not share your email address outside Company and its affiliates, except as required for our business relationship or for registering you for third-party services at your request.

You can choose not to receive marketing emails at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions or contacting us at [support@okviz.com](mailto:support@okviz.com]). However, this will not affect emails necessary to perform our business relationship or to comply with legal obligations.

### Opt-Out

For marketing-related communications, we will only provide such information after obtaining your consent, where legally required. You can opt out of receiving marketing-related communications at any time by emailing us. Users cannot typically opt out of service-related communications necessary for the execution of the relevant business relationship.
